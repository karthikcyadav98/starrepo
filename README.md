In this project I have used:

  1. React Semantic UI kit.
  2. Moment for date formatting
  3. axios from api calling.
  
Steps to for running the app:

step 1: clone the github repo https://github.com/karthikcyadav98/starrepo.git

step 2: npm install (install all the packages used in this project)

step 3: npm start (this hosts the project in localhost:3000)

Review the project.
